// ra2stats.h -- local round statistics log
//
// Replaces the GameSpy `gstats` SDK that shipped with RA2 v2.25.  That
// subsystem accumulated per-round numbers in a tagged-value store and
// uploaded them to gamestats.gamespy.com, which has been offline for years;
// every round start still paid for a DNS lookup and a connect attempt to a
// dead host, and anything it could not send went into an on-disk retry cache
// that was never drained.
//
// The numbers it collected were worth keeping, so they are collected here
// instead and appended to a local file, one JSON object per round.  Nothing
// leaves the machine and nothing is linked in beyond libc.
//
// Controlled by two cvars, mirroring RA2's own logfile/logname pair:
//
//   statsfile   0 = off, 1 = on (default 1)
//   statsname   file name inside the game directory (default ra2stats.jsonl)
//
// gslog.c's StdLog is unaffected -- it logs individual kills and connects
// across the whole server, where this logs a per-arena, per-round summary.
